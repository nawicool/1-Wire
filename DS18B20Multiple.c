//DS18B20 1-Wire Device  Version 2

/*
Release Notes:

-Fixed a few bugs with writes to a specific pin number, rather than the variable 'pin'
-Improved timing.  I found that in cold temperatures the CRC checker was finding errors every once and a while
-Added a convert checker. Now when you convert, you don't have to wait out the 750ms.  The code checks for a complete bit
-  NOTE! This only works when when you're using 3 wires, not in parasitic mode
-Added a CRC count, so you can keep an eye on total errors.

...Library coming soon
